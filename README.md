# Data-Scopes

Data Scopes is a concept for dealing with complex data in a humanities research context. With this concept we want to communicate to contribute to methodological reflection on the processes of preparing and analyzing humanities research data, and how they shape and contribute to interpretation. The Data Scopes concept and framework were developed by [Rik Hoekstra](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rik_Hoekstra) and [Marijn Koolen](https://marijnkoolen.com/#/) at the [Humanities Cluster](https://huc.knaw.nl) of the [Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences](https://knaw.nl/nl).
